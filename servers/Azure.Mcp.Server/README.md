# 🌟 Azure MCP Server

The Azure MCP Server implements the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) to create a seamless connection between AI agents and Azure services.  Azure MCP Server can be used alone or with the [GitHub Copilot for Azure extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azure-github-copilot) in VS Code.  This project is in Public Preview and implementation may significantly change prior to our General Availability.


>[!WARNING]
>**Deprecation Notice: SSE transport mode has been removed in version [0.4.0 (2025-07-15)](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/CHANGELOG.md#040-2025-07-15).**
>
> SSE was deprecated in MCP `2025-03-26` due to [security vulnerabilities and architectural limitations](https://blog.fka.dev/blog/2025-06-06-why-mcp-deprecated-sse-and-go-with-streamable-http/). Users must discontinue use of SSE transport mode and upgrade to version `0.4.0` or newer to maintain compatibility with current MCP clients.

## 🔄️ Upgrading Existing Installs to the Latest Version

<details>
<summary>How to stay current with releases of Azure MCP Server</summary>

#### NPX

If you use the default package spec of `@azure/mcp@latest`, npx will look for a new version on each server start. If you use just `@azure/mcp`, npx will continue to use its cached version until its cache is cleared.

#### NPM

If you globally install the cli via `npm install -g @azure/mcp` it will use the installed version until you manually update it with `npm update -g @azure/mcp`.

#### Docker

There is no version update built into the docker image.  To update, just pull the latest from the repo and repeat the [docker installation instructions](#docker-install).

#### VS Code

Installation in VS Code should be in one of the previous forms and the update instructions are the same. If you installed the mcp server with the `npx` command and  `-y @azure/mcp@latest` args, npx will check for package updates each time VS Code starts the server. Using a docker container in VS Code has the same no-update limitation described above.

## ⚙️ Advanced Install Scenarios (Optional)

<details>
<summary>Docker containers, custom MCP clients, and manual install options</summary>

### 🐋 Docker Install Steps (Optional)

Microsoft publishes an official Azure MCP Server Docker container on the [Microsoft Artifact Registry](https://mcr.microsoft.com/artifact/mar/azure-sdk/azure-mcp).

For a step-by-step Docker installation, follow these instructions:

1. Create an `.env` file with environment variables that [match one of the `EnvironmentCredential`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.environmentcredential) sets.  For example, a `.env` file using a service principal could look like:

    ```bash
    AZURE_TENANT_ID={YOUR_AZURE_TENANT_ID}
    AZURE_CLIENT_ID={YOUR_AZURE_CLIENT_ID}
    AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET={YOUR_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET}
    ```

2. Add `.vscode/mcp.json` or update existing MCP configuration. Replace `/full/path/to/.env` with a path to your `.env` file.

    ```json
    {
      "servers": {
        "Azure MCP Server": {
          "command": "docker",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "-i",
            "--rm",
            "--env-file",
            "/full/path/to/.env"
            "mcr.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/azure-mcp:latest",
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

Optionally, use `--env` or `--volume` to pass authentication values.

### 🤖 Custom MCP Client Install Steps (Optional)

You can easily configure your MCP client to use the Azure MCP Server. Have your client run the following command and access it via standard IO.

```bash
npx -y @azure/mcp@latest server start
```

### 🔧 Manual Install Steps (Optional)

For a step-by-step installation, follow these instructions:

1. Add `.vscode/mcp.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "servers": {
        "Azure MCP Server": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "-y",
            "@azure/mcp@latest",
            "server",
            "start"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    You can optionally set the `--namespace <namespace>` flag to install tools for the specified Azure product or service.

1. Add `.vscode/mcp.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "servers": {
        "Azure Best Practices": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "-y",
            "@azure/mcp@latest",
            "server",
            "start",
            "--namespace",
            "bestpractices" // Any of the available MCP servers can be referenced here.
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Data Collection

The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send it to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may turn off the telemetry as described in the repository. There are also some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications together with a copy of Microsoft's [privacy statement](https://www.microsoft.com/privacy/privacystatement). You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.

### Telemetry Configuration

Telemetry collection is on by default.

To opt out, set the environment variable `AZURE_MCP_COLLECT_TELEMETRY` to `false` in your environment.

## 📝 Troubleshooting

See [Troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for help with common issues and logging.

### 🔑 Authentication

<details>
<summary>Authentication options including DefaultAzureCredential flow, RBAC permissions, troubleshooting, and production credentials</summary>

The Azure MCP Server uses the Azure Identity library for .NET to authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID. For detailed information, see [Authentication Fundamentals](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/docs/Authentication.md#authentication-fundamentals).

If you're running into any issues with authentication, visit our [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#authentication).

For enterprise authentication scenarios, including network restrictions, security policies, and protected resources, see [Authentication Scenarios in Enterprise Environments](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/docs/Authentication.md#authentication-scenarios-in-enterprise-environments).
</details>

## 🛡️ Security Note

Your credentials are always handled securely through the official [Azure Identity SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/identity/Azure.Identity/README.md) - **we never store or manage tokens directly**.

MCP as a phenomenon is very novel and cutting-edge. As with all new technology standards, consider doing a security review to ensure any systems that integrate with MCP servers follow all regulations and standards your system is expected to adhere to. This includes not only the Azure MCP Server, but any MCP client/agent that you choose to implement down to the model provider.
